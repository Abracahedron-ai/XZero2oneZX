# Zero2oneZ Project

A comprehensive 3D scene manipulation toolkit with integrated AI agents.

## Project Overview

Zero2oneZ is a real-time object tracking and quality-gated 3D asset generation system that combines professional-grade transformation tools, an agent-based asset pipeline, emotion-driven AI characters, and a comprehensive AV mixing board into a rig-centric virtual production platform.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- `animation_tools`: Tools for keyframe animation, timeline management, and pose libraries
- `scene_building_tools`: Viewport, hierarchy editor, property editors, and asset shelf
- `character_tools`: Personality editor, emotion tagging, behavior trees, and dialogue management
- `vfx_tools`: HTML/CSS effects, shader editing, particle systems, and compositing
- `audio_tools`: TTS, voice modulation, and sound libraries
- `project_management`: Asset tracking, task management, and version control
- `streaming`: OBS integration, WebRTC server, and stream overlays
- `video_production`: Storyboarding, shot lists, and rendering pipeline
- `game_dev`: Level editing, gameplay scripting, and multiplayer networking
- `avatar_creation`: Character customization, outfit libraries, and animation
- `architectural_viz`: CAD importing, material libraries, and visualization tools
- `product_design`: CAD sketching, geometry editing, and AR QC tools
- `ai_agents`: Background daemons for content generation and optimization
