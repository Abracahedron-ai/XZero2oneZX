# Behavior Tree Editor

The Behavior Tree Editor provides a visual interface for creating and managing AI character behaviors.

## Features

- Node-based visual editor
- Standard behavior tree nodes (sequence, selector, parallel, decorator)
- Custom action and condition nodes
- Behavior tree debugging and visualization
- Real-time behavior monitoring
- Behavior tree templates and presets
- Variable blackboard for sharing data
- Sub-tree management and reuse
- Behavior prioritization
- Event-driven behaviors

## Implementation

The Behavior Tree Editor is implemented as a node-based graph editor that allows for the visual creation of complex AI behaviors. It compiles behavior trees into executable code that drives character actions.

## Technical Requirements

- Efficient behavior tree execution
- Visual debugging and monitoring
- Integration with the personality and emotion systems
- Support for various behavior tree patterns
