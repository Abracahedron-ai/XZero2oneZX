# Animator

The Animator agent is responsible for generating animations, poses, and motion sequences for characters and objects.

## Capabilities

- Generate character animations from descriptions
- Convert motion capture data to character animations
- Create natural transitions between animations
- Generate variations of existing animations
- Create procedural animation cycles
- Generate emotional expressions and gestures
- Create physically accurate object animations
- Generate crowd animations with variations
- Synchronize animations with audio

## Implementation

The Animator agent uses:
- Motion synthesis neural networks
- Physics-based animation
- Procedural animation generation
- Motion capture processing
- Inverse kinematics solvers
- Emotional expression mapping

## Input Formats

- Animation descriptions
- Reference video
- Motion capture data (BVH, FBX)
- Emotion and gesture specifications
- Audio for synchronization
- Physical simulation parameters

## Output Formats

- Animation clips (FBX, glTF)
- Skeletal animation data
- Blend shapes/morph targets
- Animation state machines
- Procedural animation rules

## Technical Requirements

- Skeleton retargeting capabilities
- Physics-based motion generation
- Character rig compatibility
- Animation quality metrics
- Performance optimization for real-time use
